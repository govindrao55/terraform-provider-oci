# oci_analytics_analytics_instance
This resource test change provides the Analytics Instance resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Analytics service.

Create a new AnalyticsInstance in the specified compartment. The operation is long-running
and creates a new WorkRequest.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_analytics_analytics_instance" "test_analytics_instance" {
	#Required
	capacity {
		#Required
		capacity_type = "${var.analytics_instance_capacity_capacity_type}"
		capacity_value = "${var.analytics_instance_capacity_capacity_value}"
	}
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"
	feature_set = "${var.analytics_instance_feature_set}"
	license_type = "${var.analytics_instance_license_type}"
	name = "${var.analytics_instance_name}"

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = "${var.analytics_instance_description}"
	email_notification = "${var.analytics_instance_email_notification}"
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	idcs_access_token = "${var.analytics_instance_idcs_access_token}"
}
```
